# Music Store Data Analysis using Postgres SQL

SQL (Structured Query Lamguage) ðŸ˜ƒ, a standardized language for relational databases, is crucial in data fields. It extracts specific data for tasks like reports and analysis, while also enforcing data accuracy through rules. This widespread skill works across various database systems. PostgreSQL, a free and open-source option, goes beyond relational databases. It offers advanced features for complex data management, making it a popular choice for many data professionals.

Leveraging PostgreSQL's power, I delved into music store data ðŸŒ . In this basic analysis report I am trying to answer few questions framed from the database. This analysis could reveal customer trends, identify popular genres, or optimize inventory management. The possibilities are vast, and the results can inform strategic.
